# Sound Wave Reverser in C

This C program reverses the pattern of a sound wave by reversing the order of its digital samples.

## How it Works

The core logic, `reverse_audio_samples`, efficiently swaps elements in a `short` integer array (representing audio samples). The `main` function demonstrates this with dummy data, showing the original and reversed sequences.

## Build and Run

### Prerequisites

  * C compiler (e.g., GCC)
